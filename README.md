Parsers for different tools

*Parsing flows produced with CICFlowMeter(written in Java) to python. 

1.) You can add the FlowMonitorPane.java present in the CICFlowMeter/src/main/java/cic/cs/unb/ca/flow/ui/ to your own CICFlowMeter folder.

2.) Make sure that you have the Example.py being ran as well for receiving the flows.
